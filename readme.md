- *Maps* The system shows the data on live map,
- *Statistics* The system can show and handle large data is available on webpage so that any one analyze it,

## Tech stacks

 - Python
 - Node.js
 - React.js 


## Installation Guide

The installation is very straight forward but has prerequisites:
The following language should be installed in the system

 1. Node.js
 2. Python 3
 
### Installation Steps: 
Follow the steps clearly to run the web app in your system 
 1. Clone the repository using the command <br>`git clone https://github.com/Anand4756/Eco-Tech.git`
 2. Then move to frontend folder using <br> `cd frontend`
 3. Type command `npm install` and let the system install all the required packages
 4. Type command `npm start` to start frontend react webapp.
*As the frontend is running but we need to install all packages in backend as well*
5. Move out of frontend directory and move to backend folder using <br> `cd backend`
6. Type command `npm install` and let the system install all the required packages.
7. Now type command `pip install requirements.txt` to install all python packages.
8. After installation of python packages as well just type `npm start` to start backend server
