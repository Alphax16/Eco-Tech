      <p>
        Among these, <strong>ðŸ˜¤ Air</strong> and <strong>ðŸ’§ Water</strong>{" "}
        pollution are the most prevalent, stemming from our everyday activities
        like traveling, cooking, washing etc..
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <strong>ðŸ”Š Noise</strong> and <strong>ðŸ’¡ Light</strong> pollution,
        though often ignored, are emerging threats with profound implications
        for human health and genetics. Research suggests that besides hearing
        loss, exposure to sound and light pollution can lead to changes in
        stress-related hormones like <strong>Cortisol</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Epinephrine</strong>, and <strong>Norepinephrine</strong>.
        Additionally, alterations in DNA Methylation, a heritable epigenetic
        mark, have been linked to these environmental factors, contributing to
        various human diseases.

        <strong>ðŸ’» Electronic waste (e-waste)</strong> results from rapid
        obsolescence of electronic devices, contaminating soil and water with
        hazardous materials. To combat these issues, responsible waste
        management, safe disposal practices, and investments in sustainable
        energy alternatives are essential.
